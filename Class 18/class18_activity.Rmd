# Download census demographic data

-   Try to recreate the choropleth for African American population that is visible on page 3 of the LOTF report.

```{r}
# Figure out what variable we need
vars <- suppressMessages(
  load_variables(
    year    = 2010, 
    dataset = "sf1"
  ) %>%
  filter(
    startsWith(name, "P")
  )
)

# Get Mecklenburg NC population counts from the decennial census (2010)
meck_black <- suppressMessages(
  get_decennial(
    geography   = "tract", 
    variables   = "P005004",
    summary_var = "P001001", 
    state       = "NC", 
    county      = "Mecklenburg",
    year        = 2010,
    geometry    = TRUE,
    show_call   = TRUE
  )
)

# Now compute the percentage of black people in each zone


# Make your first basic map


# Use tm_polygons and tm_layout to get closer to the LOTF report visual


```

The original from the LOTF report:

# Take a new approach, grabbing all the populations at once

-   What change do you need to make to the code to make each map?

```{r}
# Define the variables we want to retrieve
racevars <- c(
  White    = "", 
  Black    = "", 
  Asian    = "", 
  Hispanic = ""
)

# Get decennial data using our variables list


# Divide each value by its summary value to arrive at a population percentage


# Create a choropleth for Hispanic, another for Asian, another for White, etc.


# What is perhaps a better way we can do this?

```

# Now map the percentage of Black or African American population in each state in the US
-   Plot a choropleth of the USA showing density of Black/African American populations by state
-   Include chart title, legend, and appropriate breaks
-   Hint: use the option shift_geo = TRUE in get_decennial

```{r}



```
